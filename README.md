Understanding my ESP32-Based Intrusion  Smart Detection Security System 
Introduction 
This Arduino code implements a smart home security system using an ESP32 microcontroller. It integrates a motion detector, buzzer, LED indicator, Blynk IoT connectivity, and a local web dashboard to allow both remote and local monitoring and control.
 1. Blynk and Wi-Fi Integration The code connects the ESP32 to the internet using Wi-Fi credentials. It uses Blynk authentication tokens to connect to the Blynk Cloud, allowing users to control the alarm system via the Blynk mobile app. This connection is initialized using `Blynk.begin()`. 
2. Hardware Configuration The PIR sensor is connected to GPIO 4 and is used to detect motion. An LED on GPIO 13 and a buzzer on GPIO 27 provide visual and audio feedback when the alarm is triggered. All pins are initialized in the `setup()` function. 
3. Blynk Virtual Pin Control A Blynk virtual switch (V1) allows the user to arm or disarm the alarm remotely. When armed, the system listens for motion. If motion is detected, an alert is triggered, and a push notification is sent using `Blynk.logEvent()`.
 4. Web Dashboard with Login The ESP32 hosts a web server with routes for login, dashboard view, toggling alarm state, and checking motion status. A login page protects access to the dashboard. If the user logs in with the correct credentials, they can view the alarm state and toggle it via a button. Motion detection is updated every second using AJAX. 
5. Alarm State Logic Three states manage the alarm: `alarmArmed`, `alarmActive`, and `inCooldown`. `alarmArmed` determines if the system is active. When motion is detected and the system is armed, `alarmActive` becomes true, turning on the buzzer and LED. After a preset time, it enters `inCooldown` to avoid repeated triggers.
